           <b>About Us</b><br></br>
           <p>When you gift jewellery you achieve immortality in their heart.</p>

<p>We are one of the newest business families in India with a family legacy of over a century in business, starting from as early as 2001. <br></br> 
Started for the noble cause of nation-building and self-sustenance in a pre-independent India, the forefathers believed ethical, honest and transparent business practices should form the foundation of the group.</p>

<p>
Having ventured into jewellery retailing in 2001 in Thrissur, Kerala, India, where we are headquartered, and as on March 31st, 2022, we have over 15 showrooms spread across India. <br></br><br></br>

Indian jewellery, its craftsmanship and variety is an amazing showcase of India’s heritage, culture and diversity. With a deep understanding of local tastes and preferences, Kalyan offers an array of traditional and contemporary jewellery designs in gold, diamonds, precious stones and other precious metals. <br></br><br></br>

We at Sriram have always believed that the customer needs to be educated and aware, as this is the first step in preventing malpractices in business. As a part of this philosophy we have conducted several campaigns over the years, to educate customers about purity, pricing and other aspects. These efforts of Sriram have gone a long way in the industry, that is now becoming more transparent towards the customer’s interests. <br></br><br></br>

We believe that this is our legacy to the industry. Inspired by the trust we have earned across varied markets, we will soon be expanding into new markets across India, GCC, USA, Singapore, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and more.
