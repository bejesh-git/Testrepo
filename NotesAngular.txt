*angular : -it is a JS framework.
            -it provide designing and development platform for creating single page application
            -latest version is 18
            -Angular is developed and maintained by google

*S/W pre-requisit:
        -nodejs
        -ts
        -angular

*angular workd on component: 
    -component : it is partial part of anular project.
                it contain logical code for angular project.
                it can be any part of project, which we can reuse multiple time

-In angular root component name is App:

*how to create component in angular
    -npx ng generate component componentName / npx ng g c componentName

-creating component generates four files
    1. html
    2. css
    3. ts
    4. spec.ts

-how to get output of individual component
    1. go to component ts file copy its selector name and write as a tag in app.HTML file.
    2. import the component in app.ts and append its name in imports Decorator.


*Databinding : -getting/ accessing data from one file to another file in same component
    1. interpolation: {{}} - in this we send data from ts => html
    2. property binding: [] - in this we set attripute/property values form ts => html
    3. event binding (): in this we send data fro html => ts
    4. two-way databinding [()] : in this we can send data from ts <=> html
            -to perform two-way data binding we have to use ngModel directory, but ngModel directory is not a part of core anfular module, it is part of formsModule ,
            -for this first we hace to import formsModule in component.ts file.

*directive inAngular
-it is used o tchange appearance and behavour as  well as preform DOM Manipulation.
    -there are three types of directives 
        1. Structural directives : -it is used to perform DOM manipulation in angular.
                                    -Structural directive are denoted with *
                                    -Structural directive are *ngIf, *ngFor, *ngSwitchCase
                                    - we can apply one directive at a time to single element
                                    -it is part of common module, so first we have to import Common 

                        -ng-template display output based on condition.
                        -to create a reference variable we use #.
        2. Attribute directives : 
                    -ngStyle: it is used to apply property on the basis of condition
                    -ngClass: it is used to apply css on the basis of condition
                    -ngModel: it is used to perform 2-way dataBinding

        3. Custom directives : 
                    -the directive created by developer -> ng g directive directivename



*use of template refference variable

parent -> @inputdecorator->child

child -> @outputdecorator-> parent
    - instance of event emitter class

*Input() Decorator - it is used to send the data from parent component to child component
*Output() Decorator - it is used to send the data from child component to parent component


*Pipes :
    -it is used to transform property value without changing its original value.
    -it is denoted by vertical "|" sign.
    - there are three types of pipe inangular.
        1. inbuilt pipe : pipe provided by angular.
                            - to use inbuilt pipe we have to import common module
        2. custom pipe : pipe crated by developer for a specific use
                            -ng generate pipe [location] pipeName
                            -ng g p [location] pipeName
        3. third party pipe : pipes that are already developed by third party vender, first we have to install it and then use it.



*how to bootstrap in angular
    -npm install bootstrap
    -go to angular.json file and in its style array import its path.
    -restart the angular server.



Layout [Nav, pagenotfound, maindashboard, footer, login]
forms[angform, utdf, rtf, ] 
    -user template driven form
    -reactive template form

*Routing in angular : 
    -navigaiton of component
    - to display component output or navigating component using routing in angular for it we write code in app.routes.ts file
    -in angular all routing component will display its output below <router-outlet></router-outlet> directory
    
    types:
        1.naming 
        2. default 
        3.re-direct routing 
        4.parameterize routing
        5. child routing
        6. wild-card routing
