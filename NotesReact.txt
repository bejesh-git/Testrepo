*react folder structure
    -node_module : all the dependencies and development dependencies will be installed in this folder
    -package.json : list of all the dependencies entry can be found here
    -package-lock.json : detailed description of all the dependencies entry can be found here
    -public: it contain static data and file in it.


*react is component basis technology
    -component: it is partial part of react project
                -which we can resuse throught react project
                -it can be any part of react project

-in react App.js is is root component

*Types of component
    1. function component : when you main focus is on UI design
    2. class component : when you have to implement complex logic we use class component.

*JSX - javascript + XML
    -it allows us to write HTML code on react.
    -it makes react code easy.
    -in JSX we have to rap multiple element inside one parent element.
    -parent element must be any block element <div><h2><p>, etc

*props - Properties
    - it is a parameter or functional parameter which is used to pass data within componenets
    - propes return data in object format
    -we can access props in function component by writing props.propsname
    -we can access props in Class component by writing this.props.propsname

*method and event in react

*state : 
    -it is used to handle essential data in class component
    -it return us object type of data
    -in class component we write state inside constructor
    -if you want to use state in function component, for that we use stateHook(>v16.0)

*setState : it is used to manipulate state data inside class component.

*how to use bootstrap in react
    -1: npm i bootstrap
    -2: go to index.js and import the parth
    -3. use bootstrap classes


render : display component output or view on browser
*conditional rendering : display component on the basis of condition
    1. use of if else : if condition is true then if block will render otherwise else block will render
    2. element as variable : in variable we store data and display inside tag and return it
    3. use of ternary operator : short hand syntax for if else. condition ? true : false
    4. use of short-circuit : if condition is true then and only then it will displey output



*Three ways to use css:
1. internal css: 
2. external css
3. module css : -it is used when we have to design for a particuler component
                -we save file with fileName.module.css
